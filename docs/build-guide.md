# Build Guide

## Standard Parts

It should be possible to find these parts from places like Amazon or electronics stores.

|                   Part                    | Quantity |
| :---------------------------------------: | :------: |
| M2 20mm Hex Standoff (4mm Outer Diameter) |    4     |
|                 M2 Screws                 |    4     |

## Case

The case design uses a stacked acrylic sandwich mount with the following layers:

|      Part       |      Material       | Quantity |
| :-------------: | :-----------------: | :------: |
|  `top-spacer`   |     3mm Acrylic     |    2     |
|     `plate`     |     5mm Acrylic     |    1     |
| `bottom-spacer` | 5mm Frosted Acrylic |    1     |
| `bottom-piece`  | 3mm Frosted Acrylic |    1     |

Frosted acrylic was chosen for the bottom pieces as it can diffuse the RGB underglow lighting better, though regular acrylic is fine as well.
