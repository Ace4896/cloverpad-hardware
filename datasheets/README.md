## Gateron KS-20 / Lekker Switches

The Wooting Lekker switches and Gateron KS-20 (which use the same mechanism, just different branding and spring weight) don't have any publicly available datasheets. However, we do have [Gateron's KS-20 product page](https://gateron.com/products/gateron-ks-20-magnetic-white-switch-set?VariantsId=10690), which lists a few key details for what we're trying to achieve:

- Total Travel: 4.1mm +/- 0.2mm
- Initial Magnetic Flux: 102 G
- Bottom Magnetic Flux: 905 G

The housing is a modified version of a 5-pin / PCB mount MX switch housing, where only the two PCB mounting pins on the sides are present.
