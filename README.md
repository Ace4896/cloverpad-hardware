# More More Keypad!

**NOTE**: This project is still a work-in-progress, this note will be removed once it's ready!

A 3-key keypad for osu!, themed after [MORE MORE JUMP!](https://www.sekaipedia.org/wiki/MORE_MORE_JUMP!) from Project Sekai.

## Usage

Make sure you have the following things installed:

- [FreeCAD 0.21](https://www.freecad.org/)
- [KiCad 7]((https://www.kicad.org/))
- [KiCad JLCPCB Tools](https://github.com/Bouni/kicad-jlcpcb-tools) (if you're using JLC for manufacturing the PCB)

First, clone the repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ace4896/more-more-keypad.git
```

Then follow the [build guide](./docs/build-guide.md), which will reference various project files from these folders:

- [**case**](./case): FreeCAD 0.21 project for the sandwich mount case. It uses the [minimal PCB](./case/minimal-pcb/)'s 3D model as a design aid.
- [**kle**](./kle): Keypad layout generated by [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com), which can be used to integrate with existing tooling.
- [**pcb**](./pcb): KiCad 7 projects for the following PCBs:
  - [**analog**](./pcb/analog): 3-key analog PCB, themed after [Haruka Kiritani](https://www.sekaipedia.org/wiki/Kiritani_Haruka).

There's a few other folders containing any material that was used for reference:

- [**datasheets**](./datasheets): Datasheets for any important parts used in this project.
