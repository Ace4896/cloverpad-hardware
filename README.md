# Harukapad

A 3-key analog keypad for osu!.

## Repository Layout

The main project files can be found in these folders:

- [**case**](./case): [FreeCAD 0.21](https://www.freecad.org/) project for the sandwich mount case. It uses the [minimal PCB](./case/minimal-pcb/)'s 3D model as a design aid.
- [**kle**](./kle): Keypad layout generated by [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com), which can be used to integrate with existing tooling.
- [**pcb**](./pcb): [KiCad 7](https://www.kicad.org/) project for the Harukapad PCB.

There's a few other folders containing any material that was used for reference:

- [**datasheets**](./datasheets): Datasheets for any important parts used in this project.

## Usage (WIP)
